# DeepCor: Denoising fMRI Data with Contrastive Autoencoders
This directory contains the source code for the following preprint: DeepCor: Denoising fMRI Data with Contrastive Autoencoders (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.31.565011v1).

## System Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
In order to run the codes, a computer that have enough cpu memories to load the fMRI images and RMA memory to support operations is needed. GPUs are optional, will accelerate the running time, but are not necessary.

## Software Requirements
### OS Requirements
